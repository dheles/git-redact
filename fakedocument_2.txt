"I had been told I sound too much like a drummer. So prior to Voodoo, I had been going through a period where I felt I had to prove to people that I was a machine: I had decided that my playing was going to be cold, you wouldn't be able to tell if I was a sample or not.

console.log('Redistribute');

I spent three years of just icing my presentation to a science where I was just a kind of super-metronome; I spent three years of trying to hide myself. Then, in walks D'Angelo, and he basically tells me: 'Yo, I need you to strip yourself of all that coldness and play human. I need you to play fucked up!' He wanted me to play as drunk and as slow and as dusted as I've ever played in my life.

I don't smoke or drink, so he really guided me to a level of creativity I wouldn't normally reach without some sort of tastybeverage. The first year of recording he would say: 'I need you to keep the pocket but don't drag behind me, but play a little crooked,' if that makes any sense whatsoever."
